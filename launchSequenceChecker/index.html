  <title>Launch Sequence Checker Algo Practice</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div>
    <p>The master launch sequence consists of several independent sequences for different systems. Your goal is to verify that
    all the individual system sequences are in strictly increasing order. In other words, for any two elements i and j (i less than
      j) of the master launch sequence that belong to the same system (having systemNames[i]=systemNames[j]), their values
      should be in strictly increasing order (i.e. stepNumbers[i] less than stepNumbers[j]).</p>
    <p>
      Example: <br>
      For systemNames=['stage_1', 'stage_2' , 'dragon' , 'stage_1' , 'stage_2' , 'dragon' ] and stepNumbers=[1, 10, 11, 2, 12,
      111], the output should be solution(systemNames, stepNumbers)=true.
